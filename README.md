# House-Price-Prediction
Developed an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time house price predictions based on user-input features. The application allows users to input property details and instantly receive price predictions, offering an intuitive and user-friendly interface. A robust machine learning model was built using algorithms such as Random Forest, Extra Trees, and Bagging Regressor to ensure accuracy and reliability. Data preprocessing was performed using Pandas and NumPy to clean and prepare the dataset, including handling missing values and normalizing features. Visualization tools like Matplotlib were used to analyze trends, while Scikit-learn was leveraged for model training and optimization. This application effectively combines machine learning and web development to deliver a practical tool for real estate insights.
